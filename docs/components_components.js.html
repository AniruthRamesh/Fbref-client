 * @module Components
 * @description This module consists of reusable UI components designed to facilitate the construction of the application's user interface. 
 * It includes components such as Dropdown for selecting from predefined options and RenderStatsRow for displaying player statistics in a tabular format. 
 * These components are designed with flexibility and reusability in mind, allowing them to be easily integrated across different parts of the application.
 * 
 * The module plays a crucial role in maintaining a consistent look and feel across the application, providing a centralized location for UI components that can be enhanced and extended as needed.
 * 
 * Future Improvements:
 * - Abstract Table Component: Plans are in place to abstract the current table presentation logic into a more generalized Table component. 
 *   This component will be designed to accept any type of data, rendering it according to a common theme while still allowing for customization as required by different parts of the application. 
 *   This abstraction aims to reduce redundancy and streamline the process of displaying tabular data, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the development of future features.
 * 
 * Components:
 * - `Dropdown`: Renders a selectable dropdown list, allowing users to choose from a set of predefined options. It's utilized throughout the application for filtering data based on specific criteria such as player names, team types, scopes of statistics, and competition formats.
 * 
 * - `RenderStatsRow`: Dynamically generates table rows based on sorted player statistics data. It includes conditional formatting for data presentation and an optional summary row to display aggregate statistics.
 *   This component exemplifies the application's data-driven approach to UI design, ensuring information is presented in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner.
 * 
 * @see {@link module:Components.Dropdown} - for implementation details about the Dropdown component.
 * @see {@link module:Components.RenderStatsRow} - for implementation details for displaying data in table format.
