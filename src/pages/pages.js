/**
 * @module Pages
 * @description The Pages module is the central hub for all user-facing components of the application, focusing currently on the Home page. 
 * This page acts as the main interface for users to interact with player statistics, facilitated through dropdown menus and sortable tables. 
 * It integrates with other key modules for data retrieval and UI components, notably leveraging React's useState for state management and useMemo for data optimization. 
 * Additionally, the use of `@tanstack/react-query` enables efficient data fetching and state synchronization.
 * 
 * As the application evolves, plans include expanding the module to incorporate advanced features. 
 * These enhancements aim to enrich the user experience with functionalities such as free-form text search for players, detailed player profiles, and comprehensive team statistics.
 * Such features will broaden the scope of the application, making it a more versatile tool for sports analysis.
 * 
 * The current focus on the Home page establishes a solid foundation for these future developments, setting the stage for a more interactive and informative platform that caters to the needs of sports enthusiasts and analysts alike.
